Global Game Jam 2019, game made by me

Credit to Fabian SÃ¶rensson, whose code for the PICO-8 game "Trollmeister"
this was based on.

To run this, get a hold of PICO-8.

h1. Non-exhaustive list of TODOs
h2. Fix bugs
It is possible to get stuck in the side of a block/solid environment
piece by just barely falling down an edge.

Ghosts behave very poorly when blocks under them are destroyed; e.g.
start moonwalking when landing, fall through the floor below, or start
flipping out on the edge of the block next to it.

Should not be able to break blocks at the top of your jump.

h2. Features
More enemies; something that can punch blocks, something that travels
along the edge (probably tough to get right behavior when destroying
blocks), something that shoots etc. Take inspiration from Solomon's
Key. Want to keep to the theme of a spooky witch house though.

More levels

Distinct worlds and environments, for example the witch's house,
followed by a forest, then maybe a castle or a cave.

More animations, like when the level starts, when grabbing a key etc.

A menu

Pickups - extra lives, something like faeries or bells in SKey, some
sort of powerup (no idea what right now)

Ability to change into cat form; should allow jumping higher, crawling
under "half-pieces", but not creating or uncreating blocks.
